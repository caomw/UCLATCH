Fastest implementation of an UPRIGHT (no rotation)
LATCH 512-bit binary feature descriptor
as described in the 2015 paper by
Levi and Hassner:

"LATCH: Learned Arrangements of Three Patch Codes"
http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03719

See also the ECCV 2016 Descriptor Workshop paper, of which I am a coauthor:

"The CUDA LATCH Binary Descriptor"
http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03986

And the original LATCH project's website:
http://www.openu.ac.il/home/hassner/projects/LATCH/

Note once again that this is an UPRIGHT LATCH, a.k.a. ULATCH.
A fast rotation- and scale-invariant version is
also available on my GitHub.

This implementation is insanely fast, matching or beating
the much simpler ORB descriptor despite outputting twice
as many bits AND being a superior descriptor.

A key insight responsible for much of the performance of
this laboriously crafted CUDA kernel is due to
Christopher Parker (https://github.com/csp256) to whom
I am extremely grateful.

CUDA CC 3.0 or higher is required.

All functionality is contained in the files UCLATCH.h
and UCLATCH.cu. 'main.cpp' is simply a sample test harness
with example usage and performance testing.
